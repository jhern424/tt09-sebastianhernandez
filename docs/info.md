## How it works

This design implements a biologically accurate Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The system consists of:

1. Two Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons:
   - Implements full ion channel dynamics (Na+, K+, leak)
   - Uses fixed-point arithmetic (16-bit, 7 decimal bits)
   - Features configurable membrane properties and channel conductances
   - Generates biologically realistic action potentials

2. STDP Synapse:
   - Connects the two neurons
   - Implements spike-timing-dependent plasticity
   - Features adjustable learning rates for potentiation and depression
   - Maintains pre- and post-synaptic traces for timing

3. Advanced Features:
   - LUT-based exponential calculations for efficiency
   - Pipelined architecture for improved performance
   - Linear interpolation for smooth dynamics
   - Overflow protection and bounded calculations

The design uses the following parameters:
- Operating Frequency: 50 MHz
- Resolution: 16-bit fixed-point
- Voltage Range: -100mV to +100mV
- Conductances: Na+ (120mS), K+ (36mS), Leak (0.3mS)

## How to test

The design can be tested in several ways:

1. Basic Functionality:
   - Apply current input through ui[7:0]
   - Monitor first neuron's membrane voltage on uo[7:0]
   - Observe spike generation on uio[0] (Neuron 1) and uio[1] (Neuron 2)
   - View second neuron's voltage on uio[7:2]

2. Spike Generation Test:
   ```verilog
   // Example test sequence
   ui_in = 8'h20;  // Apply moderate current
   #1000;          // Wait for spike
   ui_in = 8'h00;  // Remove current
   #2000;          // Observe recovery
   ```

3. STDP Learning:
   - Generate spikes in first neuron
   - Observe synaptic weight changes
   - Monitor second neuron's response

4. Debug Outputs:
   - Gate variables (m, h, n) available for monitoring
   - Pre- and post-synaptic trace values
   - Pipeline stage status

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for basic operation. However, for detailed analysis, the following might be useful:

1. Oscilloscope or Logic Analyzer:
   - Monitor membrane voltage waveforms
   - Capture spike timing
   - Observe synaptic weight changes

2. Signal Generator (optional):
   - Generate precise current injection patterns
   - Test frequency response
   - Analyze refractory period

## Target Performance

The design aims to achieve:
- Temporal Resolution: 0.1ms
- Voltage Resolution: 0.1mV
- Spike Generation: ~2ms width
- STDP Window: Â±20ms
- Maximum Firing Rate: 200Hz

## Resource Usage

The implementation utilizes:
- LUT Resources: 256 entries for exponential calculation
- Memory: Minimal, mainly for state variables
- Pipeline Stages: 4 for neuron, 2 for synapse
- Fixed-Point Units: Multipliers and dividers with overflow protection

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:
1. Additional ion channels for more complex dynamics
2. Multiple synapse types (excitatory/inhibitory)
3. Neuromodulation capabilities
4. Parameter runtime configurability
5. Extended STDP learning rules
